# Linux for Health OpenShift Support

LFH provides "QuickStart" scripts to provision an [OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster](https://www.openshift.com/), and install LFH resources within the OCP cluster.
Supported cloud platforms include Azure, with additional platforms coming soon!


## Pre-requisites

- [Register](https://developers.redhat.com/register) for a free Red Hat Developer Account.
- Download the OC CLI toolkit from the Red Hat developer site
- Optional: Download the Azure CLI toolkit if working with OCP on Azure.

## Provision OCP cluster on Azure

The `aro-quickstart.sh` script provisions a working Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO).  Setting up ARO requires the following:

- Azure "users" are able to create application registrations and service principals.
- An Azure account that is a member of the "User Access Administrator" role within the Subscription.
- A raised Compute/CPU quota of at least 40 for the DsV3 family of VMs within the desired region.

Login to Azure
```shell script
# the CLI will open the default browser and authenticate using the Azure portal
az login
```

To create the OCP cluster
```shell script
# the script will return once the provisioning requests are sent to the Azure Resource Manager
# the process takes approximately 30 - 40 minutes to complete
./aro-quickstart [Subscription Name] [Resource Group Name] [Region Name] install
```

When provisioning is complete, view connection information
```shell script
# returns credentials, and URLs for the console and api server
./aro-quickstart [Subscription Name] [Resource Group Name] [Region Name] connection-info
```

To remove/delete the OCP quickstart
```shell script
./aro-quickstart [Subscription Name] [Resource Group Name] [Region Name] remove
# the script will return once the deletion requests are sent to the Azure Resource Manager, and provide commands
# to monitor deletion progress and remove remaining resources.
```

## Provision LFH Within an Existing OCP Cluster

The `lfh-quickstart.sh` script provisions LFH within an existing OCP cluster. The script supports any OCP cluster environment including Azure, Red Hat, AWS, or locally with Code Ready Containers (CRC).

Install the LFH quickstart
```shell script
# login (if not currently authenticated)
oc login -u [username] -p [password] [openshift api endpoint]
./lfh-quickstart.sh install
```

Remove the LFH quickstart
```shell script
# login (if not currently authenticated)
oc login -u [username] -p [password] [openshift api endpoint]
./lfh-quickstart.sh remove
```
