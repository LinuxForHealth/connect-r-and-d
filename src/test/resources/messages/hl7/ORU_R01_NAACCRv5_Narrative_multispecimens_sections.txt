OBX|2|TX|22634-0^Gross Pathology^LN^L567^GROSS PATHOLOGY^L|3|Part #3 is labeled "contents of left radical mastectomy" and is received flesh. It consists of a large ellipse of skin overlying breast tissue, the ellipse measuring 20 cm in length and 14 cm in height. A freshly sutured incision extends 3 cm directly lateral from the areola, corresponding to the closure for removal of part #1. Abundant amounts of fibrofatty connective tissue surround the entire breast and the deep aspect includes an 8 cm length of pectoralis minor and a generous mass of overlying pectoralis major muscle. Incision from the deepest aspect of the specimen beneath the tumor mass reveals tumor extension gross to within 0.5 cm of muscle. Sections are submitted according to the following code: DE – deep surgical resection margins; SU, LA, INF, ME -- full thickness radial samplings from the center of the tumor superiorly, laterally, inferiorly and medially, respectively: NI – nipple and subjacent tissue. Lymph nodes dissected free from axillary fibrofatty tissue from levels I, II, and III will be labeled accordingly. ||||||F|||200407280841|33D1234567^INDEPENDENT LAB SERVICES^CLIA
OBX|3|TX|22635-7^Microscopic Pathology^LN^L589^MICROSCOPIC^L|3|Part #3 includes 18 lymph nodes, three from Level III, two from Level II and thirteen from Level I. All lymphnodes are free of disease with the exception of one Level I lymph node, which contains several masses of metastatic carcinoma. All sections taken radially from the superficial center of the resection site fail to include tumor, indicating the tumor to have originateddeep within the breast parenchyma. Similarly, there is no malignancy in the nipple region, or in the lactiferous sinuses. Sections of deep surgical margin demonstrate diffuse tumor infiltration of deep fatty tissues, however, there is no invasion of muscle. Total size of primary tumor is estimated to be 4 cm in greatest dimension.||||||F|||200704110841|33D1234567^INDEPENDENT LAB SERVICES^CLIA
